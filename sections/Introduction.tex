The goal of all physics around the world is to understand nature. From the Universe itself and huge objects like black holes described by Einstein's General Theory of relativity down to the smallest objects the fundamental particles describe by the \acrfull{sm} of particle Physics.
The vast difference is not only size but also in time. The Cosmological timescale is often millions of years while particle physics work with life times as low as $10{-25}$s.
All cases come with their own unique challenges and obstacles, but in a sense all are equal all are described by physics. Combing the different theory is however not trivial.
The general relativity describes gravity but the quantum field theory and subsequently the SM doesn't include a particle that describes gravity. The search for a theory beyond the SM is one aspect of modern physics.
At the \acrfull{lhc} measurement for most aspect of particle physics are conducted. One of the aspects is the scattering of $W^{\pm }$ and the $Z$ Boson and there interaction with the Higgs-Boson.
