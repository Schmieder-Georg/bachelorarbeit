Vector Boson Scattering(VBS) refers to the scattering of any electroweak gauge Boson V=$W^{\pm}$, Z, $\gamma$. This 
Definition includes diboson processes which makes it necessary to specify the finale state for VBS and diboson processes.
The VBS finale state $VVjj$ is characterized by the two Bosons and two jets while diboson processes finale state only contains
two Bosons $VV$ in the finale state. Since gauge bosons have a short half-life of $3 \cdot 10^{-25}$s one needs to include the
decay of the outgoing boson leading to the full process $qq\rightarrow VVjj\rightarrow 4ljj$ shown in figure \ref{fig:feynman_full_VBS}.
In leading order only quark-initiated diagrams produce vector bosons. These quarks are shifted by a small angle away from
the beam axis resulting in the for the VBS process characteristic tagging jets. The couplings a to e in \ref{fig:feynman_full_VBS}
are all electroweak interactions and based on there coupling structure produce a squared matrix element
$\left\lvert M^{2} \right\rvert \propto \alpha_{EW}^{6}$. The $\alpha_{EW}$ stands for the combined coupling strength of
the electroweak and electromagnetic interactions. These couplings can also be achieved by coupling structure
$\left\lvert M^{2} \right\rvert \propto \alpha_{EW}^{4}\alpha_{S}^{2}$,but these couplings however do not contribute to VBS processes.
In the signal for VBS processes the diagrams with less than six electroweak diagrams are considered as Background defining the $VVjj-EW6$ processes.
Some examples for the these processes can be seen in \ref{fig:EW6}. How these processes are selected will be discussed in the following chapter.
The $W^{\pm}Z$ processes is dominated by EW and QCD interactions specifically the EFT Terms are only accounted for in the EW interactions.
