Vector Boson Scattering(VBS) refers to the scattering of any electroweak gauge Boson V=$W^{\pm}$, Z, $\gamma$. This
Definition includes diboson processes which makes it necessary to specify the finale state for VBS and diboson processes.
The VBS finale state $VVjj$ is characterized by the two Bosons and two jets while diboson processes finale state only contains
two Bosons $VV$ in the finale state. Since gauge bosons have a short half-life of $3 \cdot 10^{-25}$s one needs to include the
decay of the outgoing boson leading to the full process $qq\rightarrow VVjj\rightarrow 4ljj$ shown in figure \ref{fig:feynman_full_VBS}.
In leading order only quark-initiated diagrams produce vector bosons. These quarks are shifted by a small angle away from
the beam axis resulting in the for the VBS process characteristic tagging jets. The couplings a to e in \ref{fig:feynman_full_VBS}
are all electroweak interactions and based on there coupling structure produce a squared matrix element
$\left\lvert M^{2} \right\rvert \propto \alpha_{EW}^{6}$. The $\alpha_{EW}$ stands for the combined coupling strength of
the electroweak and electromagnetic interactions. These couplings can also be achieved by coupling structure
$\left\lvert M^{2} \right\rvert \propto \alpha_{EW}^{4}\alpha_{S}^{2}$,but these couplings however do not contribute to VBS processes.
In the signal for VBS processes the diagrams with less than six electroweak diagrams are considered as Background defining the $VVjj-EW6$ processes.
Some examples for the these processes can be seen in \ref{fig:EW6}. How these processes are selected will be discussed in the following chapter.
The $W^{\pm}Z$ processes is dominated by EW and QCD interactions specifically the EFT Terms are only accounted for in the EW interactions.\\\\

Multiple factors make the study of VBS processes interesting. VBS processes are only accessible from LHC Run-II and forward making them more relevant in the future.
The appearance of both triple and quadratic gauge couplings lead to interesting studies polarization, gauge invariance, unitarity and Higgs physics.
The distinct two jet finale state makes the selection of VBS process relatively easy leading to a small Background estimation. In BSM both properties
are relevant as new Models often include triple and quadratic gauge couplings and without knowing the underlying theory it is hard know the impact of an BSM theory on the Background.
In EFT triple gauge coupling are essential for analysis on dim-6 operates and quadratic gauge coupling for studying dim-8 operators. The accessibility of a variety of couplings and
the fact that no BSM theory to date fully describes anomalous couplings motivate the research on resonances in VBS using EFT.
